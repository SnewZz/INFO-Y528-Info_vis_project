### Installation

***

As presented in the previous section, several technologies have been used in this repository : For the preprocessing part we used Jupyter Notebook and for the visualization we used Node.js for the backend (with Express.js) and HTML, js and bootstrap for the frontend.

For the Preprocessing, you just need to run it and maybe pip install some of the libraries that are mentionned in the report.

For the Visualization, you must download several modules for Node.js. All these modules are precised in the package.json and the package-lock.json files. To download them you first need to go in the Visualization folder and do the following command :

<code> npm install </code>

Once it is done, you can run the application on you localhost (port 3000 by default) with the command : 

<code> node ./backend/api/index.js </code>
